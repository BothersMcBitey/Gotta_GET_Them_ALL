# Gotta_GET_Them_ALL

## Work in your groups of 2-3 to make a single game
API documentation: PokéAPI (pokeapi.co)
Recommended early on: Understand the Pokemon starter code (code below) to fully understand accessing data from the API


- The Pokémon data MUST come from the PokeApi
- Get random Pokémon for at least the CPU (Player can be chosen or random)
- Game can be for one or two players
- Assigning Pokemon to each player:
  - Get a random Pokemon for at least the CPU player
  - The human player can choose their Pokemon or it can be assigned to them at random
- Pokémon should fight and a winner should be declared in some way


No Pygame. Focus on interacting with the API, should be a CLI game
Be as creative as you like after this. Can you incorporate different abilities/stats etc.?
